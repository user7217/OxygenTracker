# Modal Flickering Solutions Attempted

## Issue
Blue box (cylinder management modal) in customers page flickers on hover and interaction.

## Solutions Attempted

### 1. JavaScript Error Fix
- **Problem**: `action.split is not a function` error
- **Fix**: Changed to `getAttribute('action')` with proper null checking
- **Result**: Fixed the error but flickering remained

### 2. Customer ID Extraction Fix
- **Problem**: Wrong customer ID extracted from URL
- **Fix**: Proper URL parsing for `/customers/CUST-ABC12345/bulk_cylinders`
- **Result**: Correct ID extracted but flickering remained

### 3. CSS Anti-Flickering Fixes
- **Approach**: Added z-index, backface-visibility, pointer-events
- **Result**: Reduced but didn't eliminate flickering

### 4. Bootstrap Modal Animation Disable
- **Approach**: Removed fade class, disabled transitions with `!important`
- **Result**: Still flickered

### 5. Custom Modal Implementation
- **Approach**: Completely replaced Bootstrap modal with custom CSS/JS
- **Result**: Worse flickering and sizing issues

### 6. Server-Side Modal (Current)
- **Approach**: Pure Bootstrap modal with server-rendered data, no JavaScript
- **Features**: 
  - No fade animation (`modal` instead of `modal fade`)
  - Static backdrop (`data-bs-backdrop="static"`)
  - No custom JavaScript
  - Current rentals from server data
- **CSS**: Force disabled all transitions and transforms

## Browser/Hardware Considerations
- Issue might be related to:
  - Browser hardware acceleration
  - Graphics driver issues
  - High DPI displays
  - Bootstrap version conflicts

## Alternative Solutions to Consider
1. Move cylinder management to a separate page instead of modal
2. Use a simple dropdown/collapse instead of modal
3. Implement as an inline form that expands within the table row
4. Use a slide-out sidebar instead of modal

## Current Status
Modal opens correctly and functions properly, but visual flickering persists despite all attempted fixes.
