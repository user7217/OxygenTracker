# Performance Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

1. **✓ Customer table sorted by active dispatches (descending)**
   - Updated sorting logic in routes.py line 606
   - Customers with most active dispatches now appear first

2. **✓ Cylinder table sorted by rental days (descending)** 
   - Updated db_service.py line 176 to sort by date_borrowed desc
   - Long-term rentals now appear first for better visibility

3. **✓ Performance optimization for customers page**
   - Changed from loading 10,000 cylinders to 5,000 rented cylinders only
   - Reduced memory usage and processing time significantly

4. **✓ Display custom_id instead of serial_number**
   - Updated customers.html template line 126
   - Shows custom_id values in active dispatches preview

5. **✓ Fixed foreign key constraint error**
   - Updated db_service.py update method to handle empty rented_to values
   - Prevents database errors when returning cylinders

## Remaining Issues to Address:

2. **Customer details filtering in cylinder table** - Need to add customer dropdown
3. **Active dispatches visibility in customer details** - Template needs updating  
4. **Type/size modification in cylinder details** - Make fields read-only
6. **Custom ID visibility in rentals page** - Update display logic
7. **Return cylinder internal server error** - Fix route handler

## Performance Improvements Made:

- Reduced cylinder query from 10,000 to 5,000 records
- Added proper database indexing on date_borrowed field
- Optimized sorting to use PostgreSQL instead of Python
- Fixed foreign key constraints to prevent database errors
